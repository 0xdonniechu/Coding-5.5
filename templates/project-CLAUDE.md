# <Project name>: <one line on what it is>

## What it does
<Two to four lines: what the product does, what it must never do, and what a bug costs (a wrong alert? lost user data? money?). The cost of a bug decides what is HARD.>

## Verify
- Unit: `<test command>`
- Build or lint: `<command>` (0 warnings)
- <Any end-to-end, replay or golden check, and when it is required>
- Owner-only or other-machine checks: <list them, so agents write "not run" instead of guessing>

## HARD: the main session does it directly, then hard-reviewer
- <The code that decides the core behaviour, where a wrong answer is silent>
- <Anything that deletes, migrates, pays, sends, or cannot be undone>
- <Credentials, auth, keys and how they are loaded>
- <Cross-component contracts, formats and test vectors>

## MEDIUM: builder builds, reviewer reviews
- <New integrations, channels, retries and rate limits, scheduling, storage outside the HARD core>
- <A bug with a clear stack trace outside the HARD areas>

## EASY: transcriber or builder, no review
- <Wording, formatting, reports from stored data, README and docstrings, renames, log cleanup>

## Rules
- Never silently change <thresholds / protected lists / formats>. Flag it and ask.
- <Grep lists or lint scripts that must stay at zero hits>
- <Git: account, author, branch naming, commit format, PR policy, "do not merge without being asked">
- <Issue tracker: where items live, language>

## Read when
- <Docs for one module, read only when a task touches it: "Touching `<path>`: read `docs/<module>.md` first". Not `@imports`: those load at launch and save nothing. Delete the section when there are none.>

## Session state
- Work in progress lives in `HANDOFF.md` (gitignored). If it exists at session start, read it before anything else. Update it with `/handoff` before `/clear`; delete it once the goal is finished and recorded.
- Durable facts go in this file or in memory, tasks in the tracker. `HANDOFF.md` holds only where the current goal stands.
